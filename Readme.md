# Practicing with a To Do List in React

This study project is a To Do List made to practice some learnings about React. Despite the size of the application, some important concepts were used, such as:
- States
- State immutability
- Lists and keys
- Properties
- Componentization


## About this small project

In this study I had some features to implement in the application:
- [x] Add a new task
- [x] Check or uncheck completed tasks
- [x] Delete a task
- [x] Show progress of completed tasks

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paulo-fs/ToDoList-React-Typescript.git
