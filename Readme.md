# Practicing with a To Do List in React

This study project is a To Do List made to practice some learnings about React. Despite the size of the application, some important concepts were used, such as:
- States
- State immutability
- Lists and keys
- Properties
- Componentization


## About this small project

In this study I had some features to implement in the application:
[x] Add a new task;
[x] Check or uncheck completed tasks
[x] Delete a task
[x] Show progress of completed tasks


## To run the project

Clone the repository
```sh
git clone
```

Open the folder's project and install the dependencies
```sh
cd 03.to-do-list-ts && npm install
```

Then, start the application
